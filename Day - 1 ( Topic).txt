VIRTUALIZATION
	-Introduction
			*process of simulating a Hardware & Software resource such as server ,storage or network in virtual or 		software environment.
			*it allows efficient utilization of resource ,improved scalability ,enhanced Flexibility and cost 		savings in IT infrastructure.

	-Types of Virtualization
		-Server Virtualization.
		-Storage Virtualization.
		-Network Virtualization.

	-Virtualization process
			-Basically one server can take place of the three  and all the application and run their different 		operating systems this is what virtualization does. 

	-Machine 
			-it create  virtual hardware by cloning physical hardware.
			-the hypervisor uses virtual hardware to create   a VM.A VM is a set of files.
			-with a hypervisor and VM ,one computer can run multiple OS simultaneously.

	-Hypervisor
			-the sw that creates and runs the virtualization is called hypervisor.
			-it allocates  and controls the sharing of machine resources such as storage space.
				Storage space.
				RAM.
				CPU.
			-two types of hypervisor is known as TYPE1 hypervisor and TYPE2 hypervisor.

	-Benefits
		-Cost savings.
		-Increased Flexibility.
		-Improved Management.
		-Enhanced Security.
		-Business Continuity.

	=Hypervisor:
		TYPE1 - BARE METAL SERVER.
			-that means there is no existing operating systems  or any other software on the machine.
			-used for hardware virtualization.
			-to create VM with TYPE1
				-Server case 
				-Hardware such as
				 Motherboard,

	==TYPE1 HYPERVISOR
		-After build our server hardware next step is to install type1 hypervisor on top of ours baremetal server.
		-so we can create and manage VM's.
		-the hypervisor will allocates the server hardware resources installing different OS  and installing 			 different applications.
		-Mainly used in Enterprise DATA CENTER.
		
	Ex for TYPE1
		-VMware ESXi ,Citrix Xen Server , Microsoft Hyper -V.


	==TYPE2 HYPERVISOR
		-TYPE1 Hypervisor installed and runs on the top of an existing Operating System.					-Typically used in personal computer.
		-Mainly used to test new software for research purposes.
		-Try out and test different operating system in an existing system.
		
	Ex for TYPE2
		-Oracle VirtualBox , Microsoft Virtual PC , VM workstation.
